            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
                In 2020 during the pandemic lockdown, many people had to change the way they went 
                about their usual routines. Of the many things that were affected, the one thing 
                that I noticed people enjoying was cutting hair. Whether it was their own, or their 
                family member’s hair, I saw people on social media having fun figuring out how to 
                approach haircuts and after a while, I decided to join in on the fun and went on to 
                find the tools I needed to get started.  
            </p>

            <p>
                However, most of the tools I found online were far over my price range and I couldn’t 
                justify spending an exorbitant amount of money on something I was just getting started with. 
                That is why I am here to help guide you with tips and tools I recommend for anyone 
                who wants to give haircutting a try without breaking the bank.             
            </p>

                <h2>Why Learn to Cut?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>There are many reasons to cut your own hair and here I will list a few:</li>
                    <li>- To save money on trips to the barbershop</li>
                    <li>- Maybe your current barber isn’t cutting it right</li>
                    <li>- You have a busy schedule and can’t divert time to visit a barber</li>
                    <li>- You’re curious about learning something new</li>

            <h2>Cutting Your Own Hair <br>(Starting Tips)</h2>
            <p>When cutting your own hair, it’s best to do with your back turned to a mirror while 
                using a hand mirror with your free hand to be able to see the back and rear sides of 
                your head you normally wouldn’t be able to see. This will help you keep a consistent 
                trim all the way through to ensure you don’t leave any bulky patches.

            <h2>Cutting Someone Else's Hair <br>(Starting Tips)</h2>
            <p>If you are cutting a family member or friend’s hair, it’s best to do it in a well-lit 
                area to make sure you have trimmed the hair evenly where you intended to. Indoor 
                lighting outside of a bathroom can provide you a false lighting that <em>may</em> 
                the haircut look complete but will have obvious bulk once seen in the proper light.
