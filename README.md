# ✂️ Make The Cut

**Make The Cut** is a personal HTML/CSS-based web project originall built for my CIS162 class and expanded for portfolio use to simplify self-haircutting for beginners. Inspired by the DIY spirit of the 2020 pandemic lockdown, this site offers accessible tools, tips, and techniques to help people learn how to cut their own hair — without breaking the bank.

## 💡 Purpose

During the pandemic, I noticed many people experimenting with cutting their own or their family’s hair. Like them, I wanted a way to learn the basics in the most affordable way. Most online guides recommended expensive tools, so I built this site to provide affordable recommendations and walk-throughs for anyone wanting to try it for themselves.
